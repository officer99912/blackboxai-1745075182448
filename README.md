# HackingType Pro Ultimate

## Project Overview
HackingType Pro Ultimate is a web-based application that simulates a hacking terminal experience. Users can interact with a fake terminal that displays various "hacking" commands and functionalities, making it perfect for demonstrations, educational purposes, or just for fun.

## Installation
To run the project, you can simply download the necessary files or clone the repository. There are no additional installations required beyond a modern web browser to view the `index.html` file.

### Steps to Install:
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open `index.html` file in any web browser.

## Usage
- Open the `index.html` in a web browser.
- Press any key to start typing the simulated commands.
- Use the slider to adjust the typing speed.
- Select script categories from the dropdown to filter the hacking messages.
- Press `Ctrl + Enter` to display "Access granted" in the terminal.
- Press `Alt + Enter` to display "Access denied" in the terminal.
- Click on the "Help" button for usage guidance or the "Credits" button to see the creator information.

## Features
- **Simulated Terminal Experience**: Typing experience mimicking command line interfaces with "hack" scripts.
- **Adjustable Typing Speed**: Users can set how fast the text is typed out in the terminal.
- **Script Selection**: A dropdown menu allows users to filter the displayed hacking scripts into categories such as Network, System, Exploit, Ransomware, and Miscellaneous.
- **Help and Credits Modal**: Provides users with documentation and credits through pop-ups.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes the following external libraries:
- **Font Awesome**: For icons.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling.
- **Google Fonts**: For custom typography.

There are no explicit dependencies listed in a `package.json` file, as the project is primarily a front-end HTML/CSS/JavaScript application.

## Project Structure
```
/project-directory
│
├── index.html          # Main HTML file with the app interface and scripts
└── [other files]       # Additional files may be included in a complete project
```

### Notes:
- The main functionality is included directly in the `index.html` file via embedded JavaScript.
- Ensure that you have internet access when running the project to load external resources like CSS and JS libraries.

Feel free to explore and enjoy the simulated hacking experience provided by HackingType Pro Ultimate!
